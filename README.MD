# Scraping Google using X-Ray

This repository just shows how to scrape Google using X-Ray, for a proof-of-concept
example. You should keep in mind the terms of service the sites you are scraping,
as it may be against their rules.

Just run `npm install` and then `node index.js` to run the example code.
